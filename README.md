# Milestone-project for User centric development 
I have created a webpage for selling eco-friendly bags and jute related products **ECOB**.
Jute is a second most using fibre after cotton and it as been using as in domestic and commercial packaging 
for thousand years in Indian subcontinent. So in my opinion it is more relvant than any other time to introduce in the west
 and to the world a eco-friendly bio-degradable product.
 Which can be save our world from excessive plastic pollution. 


 ## UX
Expected users of the website specially the companies and organisation or individuals who want a more cleaner world and a plastic free world.
**User Stories**
1. Any one can buy and order our products from one single quantity to a large quantity.
1. Anyone with a curisity of jute can learn about this new type of material.
1. Fashion personells can promote an eco friendly product.
1. Environment activists can use a product which might support their cause.
* During the process of my webpage Buliding, I with the help of one of my friend made a logo as below:
