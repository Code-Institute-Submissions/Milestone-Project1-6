# Milestone-project for User centric development 
I have created a webpage for selling eco-friendly bags and jute related products ECOB.
Jute is a second-most using fiber after cotton and it has been used as in domestic and commercial packaging for
thousand years in the Indian subcontinent. 
So, in my opinion, it is more relevant than any other time to introduce an eco-friendly bio-degradable product.
Which can save our world from excessive use of plastics?


 ## UX
Expected users of the website especially the companies and organizations or individuals who want a more cleaner 
world and a plastic-free world.
**User Stories**
1. Anyone can buy and order our products from one single quantity to a large quantity.
1. Anyone with a curiosity about jute can learn about this new type of material.
1. Fashion personals can promote an eco-friendly product.
1. Environment activists can use a product that might support their cause.
* During the process of my webpage Building, I with the help of one of my friend made a logo as below:
![GitHub Logo](project/images/logolight.png)
Logo concept is green earth and three leaves of Jute plant.

## Features
Users can view some images of our products on the front page and a little information about the fibre.
 In the "About Jute" section anyone can get some ideas about Jute cultivation and process to be a commodity.
  Moreover, a video to gather some of the information about the product At the Products page you can see our product catalog which 
  I have collaborated with a local company in Bangladesh and buy. The contact page is there to receive user's feedbacks, suggestions and complaints to develop our service. In the Product page, I have added a "Catalogue" button to view our product catalog in a new page as a pdf file, so that anyone can download the catalog. 
By clicking the button "Buy now" below the product image, there will be a modal contains a welcome text.
